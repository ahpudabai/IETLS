When Thomas Keller, one of America's foremost chefs, announced that on Sept. 1 he would abolish the practice of tipping at Per Se. his luxury restaurant in New York City, and replace it with European-style service charge, I knew three groups would be opposed: customers, servers and restaurant owners. These three groups are all committed to tipping. -as they quickly made
clear on Web sites. To oppose tipping, it seems, is to be anticapitalist, and maybe even a little French..
But Mr. Keller is right to move away from tipping and it's worth exploring why just about everyone else in the restaurant world is wrong to stick with the practice.
Customers believe in tipping because they think it makes economic sense. "Waiters know that they won't get paid if they don't do a good job" is how most advocates of the system would put it. To be sure, this is a tempting, apparently rational statement about economic theory, but it appears to have little applicability to the real world of restaurants.
Michael Lynn, an associate professor of consumer behavior and marketing at Cornell's School of Hotel Administration, has conducted dozens of studies of tipping and has concluded that consumers' assessments of the quality of service correlate weakly to the amount they tip.
Rather, customers are likely to tip more in response to servers touching them lightly and leaning forward next to the table to make conversation than to how often their water glass is
refilled- in other words, customers tip more when they like the server, not when the service is good. Mr. Lynn's studies also indicate that male customers increase their tips for female servers while female customers increase their tips for male servers.

What's more, consumers seem to forget that the tip increases as the bill increases. Thus, the tipping system is an open invitation to what restaurant professionals call "upselling": every bottle of imported water, every espresso and every cocktail is extra money in the server's pocket.
Aggressive upselling for tips is often rewarded while low-key, quality service often goes unrecognized.

In addition, the practice of tip pooling, which is the norm in fine-dining restaurants and is becoming more in every kind of restaurant above the level of a greasy spoon, has ruined whatever effect voting with your tip might have had on an individual waiter. In an unreasonable outcome, you are punishing the good waiters in the restaurant by not tipping the bad one. Indeed, there appear to be little connection between tipping and good service.

If she hopes her new-found fortune will yield lasting feelings of fulfillment, she could do worse than read Happy Money by Elizabeth Dunn and Michael Norton.

This slim volume is packed with tips to help wage slaves as well as lottery winners get the most "happiness bang for your buck." It seems most people would be better off if they could shorten their commutes to work, spend more time with friends and family and less of it watching television (something the average American spends a whopping two months a year doing, and is hardly jollier for it). Buying gifts or giving to charity is often more pleasurable than purchasing things for oneself, and luxuries are most enjoyable when they are consumed sparingly. This is apparently the reason McDonald's restricts the availability of its popular McRib a marketing trick that has turned the pork sandwich into an obiect of obsession.
Readers of Happy Money are clearly a privileged lot, anxious about fulfillment, not hunger.
Money may not quite buy happiness, but people in wealthier countries are generally happier than those in poor ones. Yet the link between feeling good and spending money on others can be seen among rich and poor people around the world, and scarcity enhances the pleasure of most things

appropriate title

In an essay entitled "Making It in America", the author Adam Davidson relates a joke from cotton country about just how much a modern textile mill has been automated: The average mill has only two employees today, "a man and a dog. The man is there to feed the dog, and the dog is there to keep the man away from the machines."
Davidson's article is one of a number of pieces that have recently appeared making the point that the reason we have such stubbornly high unemployment and declining middle-class incomes today is largely because of the big drop in demand because of the Great Recession, but it is also because of the advances in both globalization and the information technology revolution, which are more rapidly than ever replacing labor with machines or foreign workers.

谈古未论今，古今有变化
middle class family 
bread winner 
homemaker 
cost-efficient

In the past, workers with average skills, doing an average job, could earn an average lifestyle. But, today, average is officially over. Being average just won't earn you what it used to.
It can't when so many more employers have so much more access to so much more above average cheap foreign labor, cheap robotics, cheap software, cheap automation and cheap genius.
重要， 结论信号
Therefore, everyone needs to find their extra--their unique value contribution that makes them stand out in whatever is their field of employment.

downsize the laborforce
lay off workers

Yes, new technology has been eating jobs forever, and always will. But there's been an acceleration. As Davidson notes, "In the 10 years ending in 2009, [U.S.] factories shed workers so fast that they erased almost all the gains of the previous 70 years; roughly one out of every three manufacturing jobs -about 6 million in total--disappeared."
There will always be changed- new jobs, new products, new services. But the one thing we know for sure is that with each advance in globalization and the I.T. revolution, the best jobs will require workers to have more and better education to make themselves above average

比较级表最高级   but nothing would be more important
In a world where average is officially over, there are many things we need to do to support employment, but nothing would be more important than passing some kind of GI. Bill for the 21" century that ensures that every American has access to post-high school education.
21. The joke in Paragraph 1 is used to illustrate
[A] the impact of technological advances
[BI the alleviation of job pressure
[C] the shrinkage of textile mills hi
[D1 the decline of middle-class incomes
22. According to Paragraph 3, to be a successful employee, one has to
[A] adopt an average lifestyle
[B] work on cheap software
[C] contribute something unique
[D] ask for a moderate salary
23. The quotation in Paragraph 4 explains that
[A] gains of technology have been erased
[B] job opportunities are disappearing at a high speed
[C] factories are making much less money than before
[D] new jobs and services have been offered
24. According to the author, to reduce unemployment, the most important is
[A] to accelerate the I.T. revolution
[B] to ensure more education for people   目的 > 大于手段
[C] to advance economic globalization
[D] to pass more bills in the 21* century

Passage 2
Questions 6 to 10 are based on the following passage:
"The word 'protection' is no longer taboo(# 5 i#". This short sentence, uttered by French President Nicolas Sarkozy late last month, may have launched a new era in economic history.
tariff 关税
trade barriers 
Why? For decades, Western leaders have believed that lowering trade barriers and tariffs was a natural good. Doing so, they reasoned, would lead to greater economic efficiency and productivity, which in turn would improve human welfare. Championing free trade thus became a moral, not just an economic, cause.
do A out of B  出于B 做出来A这件事

These leaders, of course, weren't acting out of unselfishness They knew their economies were the most competitive, so they'd profit most from liberalization. And developing countries 
feared that their economies would be swamped by superior Western productivity. 

Today, however. the tables have turned-though few acknowledge it. The West continues to preach free trade, but practices it less and less. Asia, meanwhile, continues to plead for special protection but practices more and more free trade.

argument 主张，观点
That's why Sarkozy's words were so important: he finally injected some honesty into the trade debate. The truth is that large parts of the West are losing faith in free trade, though few leaders admit it, some economists are more honest. Paul Krugman is one of the few willing to acknowledge that protectionist arguments are returning. In the short run, there will be winners and losers under free trade. This, of course, is what capitalism is all about. But more and more of these will be in the West. Economists in the developed world used to love quoting Joseph Schumpeter, who said that "creative destruction" was an essential part of capitalist growth. But they always assumed that destruction would happen over there. When Western workers began losing jobs, suddenly their leaders began to lose faith in their principles. Things have yet to reverse completely. But there's clearly a negative trend in Western theory and practice.

drifting away 越来越远
A little hypocrisy (A I) is not in itself a serious problem. The real problem is that Western governments continue to insist that they retain control of the key global economic and financial institutions while drifting away from global liberalization. Look at what's happening at the IMF (International Monetary Fund). The Europeans have demanded that keep the post of managing director, but all too often, western officials put their own interests above everyone else's when they dominate these global institutions.
The time has therefore come for the Asians-who are clearly the new winners in today's global economy-to provide more intellectual leadership in supporting free trade. Sadly, they have yet to do so. Unless Asians speak out, however, there's a real danger that Adam Smith's principles, which have brought so much good to the world, could gradually die. And that would leave all of us worse off, in one way or another.


6.It can be inferred that "protection" (Line 1, Para. 1) means
A.improving economic efficiency
B.ending the free-trade practice
C.lowering moral standard
D.raising trade tariffs
7. The Western leaders preach free trade because
A.it is beneficial to their economies
B.it is supported by developing countries
C.it makes them keep faith in their principles
D.it is advocated by Joseph Schumpeter and Adam Smith
原因 > 现象  目的 > 手段
8.By "the tables have turned" (Lines3-4, Para.2) the author implies that 
A.the Western leaders have turned self-centered
B.the Asian leaders have turned advocates of free trade
C.the developed economies have turned less competitive
D.the developing economies have become more independent
9. The Western economists used to like the idea of "creative destruction" because it
A.set a long-term rather than short-term goal
B.was an essential part of capitalist development
C.entailed a positive rather than negative mentality
D.was meant to be the destruction of developing economies
10. The author uses "IMF" as an example to illustrate the point that
A. European leaders are reluctant to admit they are hypocritical
B.there is an inconsistency between Western theory and practice
C.global institutions are not being led by true globalization advocates
D. European countries' interests are being ignored by economic leaders
